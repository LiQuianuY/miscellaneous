* **deterrent**
  * a thing that discourages or is intended to discourage someone from doing something.
  * > *Cameras are a major deterrent to crime.*
* **an end in itself**
  * a goal that is pursued in its own right to the exclusion of others.
    * > *Competition is not an end in itself.*
  * something that one does because one wants to and not because it will help achieve or accomplish something else.
    * > *She started exercising for her health, but she enjoyed it so much that exercising became an end in itself.*
    * > *For him, taking classes was an end in itself.*


> *Despite the familiarity of the subject, the survey we are about to undertake will probably seem quite **novel**; it does not aim to present an extended review of old material, but to condense this knowledge into a few simple and obvious properties of numbers.*

* **novel**
